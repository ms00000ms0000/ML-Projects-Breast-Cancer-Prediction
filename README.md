# ML-Projects-Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This **Machine Learning project** focuses on **Breast Cancer Classification** using the **Logistic Regression** algorithm. The model utilizes the **predefined Breast Cancer dataset from Scikit-learn**, which contains key diagnostic features used to classify tumors as **Benign (1)** or **Malignant (0)**. The dataset was processed and trained using supervised learning techniques to accurately distinguish between the two classes. The model achieved an impressive **accuracy of 92%**, showcasing its reliability in early cancer detection. This project highlights the use of **Machine Learning in healthcare**, aiding in **medical diagnosis and decision support** for improving patient outcomes through data-driven analysis.
